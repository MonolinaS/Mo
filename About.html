      Tell us about a time you embraced a new system, process,
      technology, or idea at work.</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>Give an example of a time when you had to adjust your style because it was not meeting the objectives 
      and/or people were not responding correctly. What was the outcome?

      I’ve always been organized, so I considered traditional home organizing, but when I explored, I realized that it
      didn’t speak to me because it felt as though something was missing. I decided to watch Tidying Up with Marie Kondo
      on Netflix. Within the first 10 minutes, I knew that was what I wanted to do. The way Marie connected
      intentionality, lifestyle, and joy with the physical things in your home spoke to me deeply. I told my friends I
      was starting an organizing business that day. To which they all said: That’s so you. I wish they told me that
      before I went to law school!</p>
    <p>
      Kathryn: Tidying, organizing, and fine-tuning the workflow of my environment is something I have always enjoyed
      (even as a child), and it comes naturally. I considered my ability more of a “quirk” than a superpower, so the
      moment I learned that professional organizing was a real thing, it was suddenly so clear what I was meant to do!
      <a href="#" class="entity listed" title="entity listed">Canadian television</a>.

    </p>
    <p>Katrina: Early on in the KonMari Method, when I was tidying my physical items, I began to understand that this
      process is so much more the making things look tidy on the surface; KonMari is all about effective
      decision-making, building confidence in the choices you make and continuing to find ways to express joy and
      enhance wellbeing in your life. The process was transformative.

      After I had gone through all of the items in my home, I began questioning if other areas of my life sparked joy,
      like my daily habits, my friendships and even my career as a teacher. KonMari gave me the confidence to leave a
      job that was leaving me feeling drained and overwhelmed and opened my eyes to a whole new world of organizing
      possibilities! As soon as I started to support my friends, family and members of my local community, teaching them
      the KonMari philosophy and supporting them in creating a joyful, organized home, I realized that they were
      experiencing the profound benefits too. When I realized I could have such a positive impact in helping others, I
      knew this was the direction my career was heading into. </p>

    <p>The new displays bring the story of country life up to the present day. The collection was begun in the 1950s
      when <a href="#" class="entity linked" title="entity linked" style="color: #374e86;">Reading University</a> staff
      realised how fast
      the countryside around them was changing, and it now takes in far more than tractors and horse-drawn
      ploughs. Another new display is a colourful but spectacularly tattered outfit worn by the environmental
      campaigner Jim Hindle, when he camped in a treehouse in an attempt to stop the building of the Newbury
      bypass in Berkshire. The nine-mile (14km) stretch of road required the felling of 10,000 trees, and in <a href="#"
        class="entity not-linked" title="entity not-linked" style="color: #374e86;">1996</a> Hindle camped in the
      branches of
      one of them, the Middle Oak. The roof was too low for him to stand, which is why the knees of his trousers
      took such heavy wear.</p>
    <p>Hughes said one of the museum’s major problems was having to tell an outdoor story in an indoor space. The
      gap has been filled with photographs including a woodland scene, blown up to near lifesize, photographed by
      her colleague Ollie Douglas on his way to work one morning.</p>
