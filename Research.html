      Kathryn: Tidying, organizing, and fine-tuning the workflow of my environment is something I have always enjoyed
      (even as a child), and it comes naturally. I considered my ability more of a “quirk” than a superpower, so the
      moment I learned that professional organizing was a real thing, it was suddenly so clear what I was meant to do!

    </p>
    <p>Katrina: Early on in the KonMari Method, when I was tidying my physical items, I began to understand that this
      process is so much more the making things look tidy on the surface; KonMari is all about effective
      decision-making, building confidence in the choices you make and continuing to find ways to express joy and
      enhance wellbeing in your life. The process was transformative.

      After I had gone through all of the items in my home, I began questioning if other areas of my life sparked joy,
      like my daily habits, my friendships and even my career as a teacher. KonMari gave me the confidence to leave a
      job that was leaving me feeling drained and overwhelmed and opened my eyes to a whole new world of organizing
      possibilities! As soon as I started to support my friends, family and members of my local community, teaching them
      the KonMari philosophy and supporting them in creating a joyful, organized home, I realized that they were
      experiencing the profound benefits too. When I realized I could have such a positive impact in helping others, I
      knew this was the direction my career was heading into. </p>
    <p>I knew I wanted to go into teaching from my mid-20s. I did a PGCE at MMU in my late 20s but the MA DTCE has given
      me a much deeper interest in and understanding of the process of learning and its potential to change lives,
      regardless of the subject. This has given me an appreciation of the value and importance of education, something
      that I had some intuition of but now deeply believe. It has also helped me realise how much there is still to be
      discovered about the educational process and the human mind it aims to develop. This has led me to continue
      studying over the past two years since graduation, putting into practice one of the central lessons I learned -
      that the best education is one that continues for life beyond the institutions that helped form and guide you.

      I now work as a lecturer and tutor on the level 2 and 3 BTEC Diploma in Creative Media Practice which has pathways
      in animation, games design, digital content creation and film.</p>
    <p>On how the course set me up for my career path
      I did the MA as a mature student at the age of 48 and had already been teaching for 20 years. The course has
      enabled me to take a more questioning approach to my own delivery as a teacher and the confidence to make my own
      decisions about which parts of the curriculum are most important and build around those, always returning to the
      question – What type of classroom environment and delivery serves the students best? Also, more confidence to
      listen to the students above all and allow them to have an input, thinking reflectively and changing things if
      they’re not working.</p>
    <p>On my learnings
      An interest in and appreciation of research. Learning to see an argument from different points of view. An
      understanding of how important facts, information and knowledge are and how the use of sources that can be checked
      are now more important than ever and the essential part institutions such as universities can play in supporting
      and upholding that process.

      On my advice for prospective students
      If you work in, are interested in working in, or are just interested in education then this course will give you a
      balanced introduction to education theory, practice and contemporary debates, and the rapidly expanding area of
      education technology alongside a solid grounding in research methods and their application. The course is well
      structured and values your own experience, giving you the opportunity to contribute to debates and exposing you to
      diverse experiences and opinions from a wide cohort of international students. The teaching and support staff
      always have time to answer questions and offer helpful advice.</p>
